        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents
        designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies
        such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript
    </p>

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
        render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
        a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
        images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
        rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
        tructural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
        and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
